## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each DAO handles one entity type
- PaymentService focuses solely on payment processing
- UI panels have specific purposes

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle**
- Payment methods easily extensible
- Order status system can be extended
- New UI panels can be added without modifying existing code

### 3. **Interface Segregation**
- Specific methods for different operations
- No unnecessary dependencies between components

### 4. **Dependency Inversion**
- Services depend on abstractions
- Database operations abstracted through DAOs

### 5. **Error Handling Strategy**
- Graceful degradation on database errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Database Requirements

The application requires the following stored procedures to be implemented in your MySQL database:

### Cart Operations
- `AddToCart(user_id, product_id, quantity, customizations)`
- `GetCartItems(user_id, currency_code)`
- `UpdateCartItemQuantity(cart_id, quantity)`
- `RemoveFromCart(cart_id)`
- `ClearCart(user_id)`
- `GetCartTotal(user_id, currency_code)`
- `GetCartItemCount(user_id)`

### Order Operations
- `CreateOrderFromCart(user_id, currency_code, delivery_address, notes, OUT order_id)`
- `GetOrderById(order_id)`
- `GetOrderItems(order_id)`
- `GetUserOrders(user_id)`
- `UpdateOrderStatus(order_id, status)`
- `GetAllOrders()`

## Future Enhancements

- **Real Payment Integration**: Connect to actual payment gateways
- **Email Notifications**: Order confirmation and status updates
